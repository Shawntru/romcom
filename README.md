## General Info

Use the RNG3000 to randomly populate the title, descriptors, and cover image for your new best-selling romantic novel. Up the stakes by adding your own sultry images and key words, which are then saved into the lists of descriptors that can come up again later! Save your favorite covers and share them with friends (Note: this feature not yet implemented in the RNG300. RNG3000 not responsible for side effects including but not limited to: writing awesome novels, random displays of affection, and/or the desire to eat nothing but whipped cream for dinner.)
